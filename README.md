# LoginMask

## Disclaimers

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.9 to assist in the Cyber Security course conducted by students of Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg on 10. January 2025. All similarities to actual product(s) and/or people are coincidental and unintentional. This single-page web application is purely frontend, runs on the client side, and does not collect any data or information from its user(s). This project was created purely for educational purposes. We do not condone or promote any illegal activity.

This application is fully open-sourced and can be used, edited, changed for any personal/commercial purposes (have to be legal of course). However, this application was built not up to industry-standard, and there will be no future update/maintainence since it was only designed to be used for our university project, so be careful when you decide to use it for production purposes.
